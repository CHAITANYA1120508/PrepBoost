PrepBoost is designed for students preparing for exams like conducted by the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) of India. UPSC conducts various exams every year like the CSE (Civil Services Examination), CDS (Combined Defense Services), CAPF (Central Armed Police Forces), NDA (National Defense Academy), and others. Our vision is to help students during their preparation with the power of technology to make their preparation easier, smarter &amp; enjoyable.

Elaborating on the project : 

1. The focus is on providing a testing platform where students can practice previous years questions and get their standings (rank) among other students. 
2. Students can attempt the questions of the past 25 years papers which will help them in their preparation.
3. Using the platform, Students can search from the thousands of questions to know about the specific questions or topic which was asked.
4. The questions are organized year and subject so that specific year questions can be found easily.
